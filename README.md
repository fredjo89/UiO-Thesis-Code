# UiO-Thesis-Code
Contains Python-code created in my work with the thesis: Finding Money Launderers Using Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks

The notebook train_test contains the script to train the models using cross valudation, and test the resulting models on the test-set. 

In the folder "models" are the implemented models explored. 

In the folder "node_features" are the notebooks used to create the additional graph-features for the nodes.
